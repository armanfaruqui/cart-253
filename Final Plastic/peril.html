        It is one world. And it’s in <span class="green"> our </span> care. For the first time in the history of humanity, for the first time in 500 million years, one species has the future in the palm of its hands.”<br>

    <ul>
      <li> Plastic's production not requiring time consuming manual work and its raw materials being cheap and widely available makes it too easy to mass produce.</li>
      <li> Since 1907, we have produced over 8.3 billion metric tonnes of plastic. 360 million tonnes in 2018 alone.
      </li>
      <li> More than 6.3 billion metric tonnes of plastic have become waste since its invention.</li>
      <li>9% of this waste has been recycled. 12% has been incinerated. 79% still remains across our planet.</li>
      <li> 8 million tonnes of it ends up in the ocean. It is predicted to outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2020 </li>

    <ul>
      <li> With how widespread plastic waste is, animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it. Many of them starve with stomachs full of indegestible garbage.</li>
      <li> In 2015, 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic.
      </li>
      <li> In 2018 a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain. It had eaten 32 KG of plastic bags, nets, and a drum.</li>
      <li>Endangered wildlife like Hawaiian monk seals and Pacific loggerhead sea turtles are among nearly 700 species that eat and get caught in plastic litter.</li>
      <li>Entanglement in plastic debris has also led to injury and mortality in the endangered Steller sea lion, with packing bands the most common entangling material. </li>

    <ul>
      <li> Microplastics refer to pieces smaller than 5mm. 51 trillion such particles exist in the ocean. </li>
      <li> Some are found in cosmetics, but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation, which causes them to crumble into smaller pieces.
      </li>
      <li> These particles travel up the food chain when they are swallowed by marine life.</li>
      <li> Chemicals added to plastic are harmful to humans. BPA for example makes plastic more flexible, but also interferes with our hormonal system.</li>
      <li>Studies conducted by researchers at the University of Newcastle in Australia, estimated that people consume about 5 grams of plastic a week - equivalent to that in a credit card </li>
