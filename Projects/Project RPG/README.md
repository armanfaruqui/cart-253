Artist Statement

After I began to grasp programming and game design in this course, I looked back at various games I connected with in my teenage years. As I was now able to somewhat comprehend the functioning behind the code used to make them, I developed an even greater appreciation for these games. When deciding what my final project would be on, I could not resist taking the grand task of making a narrative based up-down RPG. I saw this project as an opportunity to have my first crack at making the type of game I’d want to make in the next few years. It’s core concept is combining intuitive top-down RPG design with narrative themes I’ve been exploring through life and with music which includes growth, mental health, human connection and moving forward from tough circumstances.

The game heavily relies on the p5.play library to function. There was little to know tutorials on how to use this library online, but luckily with the help of worked examples from https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/examples/index.html, I was able to effectively use sprites and animations for my project. There were quite few issues and weird bugs at first, but the more time I spent on the project, the more my understanding of the code’s ‘language’ improved.

Through the code and this essay, I often refer to the character which is played as the ‘player’, and the human playing the game as the ‘user’. Since a major focus was blending these 2 separate entities into 1 as much as possible, it can often get confusing to an outside reader, so keep that in mind.

The game opens with the player in his bedroom. My immediate goal was to clearly present the player’s depressed mood, without making it seem excessively overt and in the user’s face. I felt I achieved this by having no music playing in an almost empty room, having the bed text indirectly mention that the player overslept, through the text on the notes app, and 2 songs on the music app . When the player interacts with the computer, the player has an option to use it. This opens a new tab on the user’s browser. I was really proud of this design because of how immersive it is to the user. It almost prompts the user to use the internet as if the player is. The user can get distracted by a twitter post or discord notification, but since that internet tab is opened from the game, it implies that the player’s experience is the same as that of the player (if that makes any sense). The tab opening to the player’s last google search also was a less overt way to present the player’s mood.

When the player enters the hall, the user is met with a narrow path leading to a big door. I tried to make moving towards the door feel intimidating through the door’s size and dominance in the canvas, along the ‘anxiety oscillator’ which has its pitch increase and sound more annoying the closer the player moves to the door. This is the first instance of having selectable text options. I used 3 of these instances for the player to leave the hall. I did this to represent how even the simplest of tasks can be a stretched out challenge when people's minds are not in the right place

The town scene is filled with an empty and sombre atmosphere. I tried to represent my sentiments of coming from a place where I felt everyone was the same, by limiting the color palette for this scene, and by using the same dialogue sound for the 2 humans that you interact with here. Unlike on other maps, the border of trees which surround it do not appear infinite. The user sees an ugly grey background which I feel gives off a feeling of emptiness and being trapped(Which sounds like a bit of a reach). The animated cute looking dog the player is met with should hopefully prompt the user to go over and interact with it. What follows is the beginning of the hostile atmosphere I try to build.  When the player goes to the butchery for their job, they get to meet the greedy and obnoxious butcher. After the player tries to go with the forest, they are met with the intrusive, trigger happy sheriff. It is a bit of commentary on my views on how most police are.

The player then enters the first forest path. They are met with a less threatening looking character sprite staring at a tree. Since some users might feel that the player confronting this stranger would be unrealistic based on the player’s mood, I made it so that the user can choose to walk past this stranger, which still results in a similar introduction. Unlike the other 2 characters you meet, this ‘friend’ has a variety of dialogue sounds which is aimed to make them feel more alive. The 2 set off and have more conversation. It becomes apparent that the role of this friend is to act as a somewhat indirect therapist, and a faucet for more positive thinking.

The lake scene acts as a climax for the game. You may notice the scenes slowly appearing to be  brighter and more colorful. I slowly increased the saturation and brightness of each scene to go along with the player's outlook becoming brighter and more positive. The player can choose to first go to the beautiful flower field where the friend sends the user a new song to play, which hopefully fits with the direction of the narrative. The player also has to interact with the lake to begin the fishing minigame. Whilst the framework for this code was taken from my project1, I had to spend a lot of time changing the assets, adding a ‘scareFish’ function which you recommended, and fixing the atrocious style I had then. Also using intermediate functions greatly reduced the length of the code.

The player can then enter the final forest Path. This time the player is made to ask more questions to portray how the player is growing more comfortable and open with the friend.
There is not much more to say about the rest of the conclusion. It would have been nice to have another month to add another scene or so to make the ending less abrupt, but I did what I could with the time I had.

The sprites and backgrounds were designed using photoshop. Due to having a deadline, I did not have enough time to design sprites and backgrounds with the detail and artistry I would have liked for a game which in theory, should rely heavily on having beautiful visuals. I did like the color palette which I used.

I found the sound design in my project to be incredibly disappointing. I did not have enough time to give it the attention it deserved. I ran into issues with using multiple different sound files for the friend’s dialogue. On the last day that Javascript began to jumble up the dialogue sound files resulting in a few not working, and a few being read as the wrong one. For example, playing friend_dialogue6 would play friend_dialogue5. This sucked because I had downloaded each sound file to carry a certain tone and mood, and tried to match it as best as I could depending on what the player was saying in each text box. It would have made the player feel so much more alive. I also wish I had more time to mix and adjust the volume and pitches of the background music for each scene. Simply downloading the songs and inputting into my code was not good practice. It interfered with the anxiety oscillators a lot too. Finally, having such short scenes made the music abruptly end too often.
